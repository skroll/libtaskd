Installation Instructions
-------------------------

Please follow the instructions below to build libtaskd with cmake.


Pre-requisites
--------------

You will need the following tools:
   cmake
   make

You will need the following libraries:
   libuuid
   gnutls

More information on cmake can be obtained at http://cmake.org


Basic Installation
------------------

Briefly, these shell commands will unpack, build and install libtaskd:

  $ tar xzf libtaskd-X.Y.Z.tar.gz               [1]
  $ cd libtaskd-X.Y.Z                           [2]
  $ cmake .                                     [3]
  $ make                                        [4]
  $ sudo make install                           [5]
  $ cd .. ; rm -r libtaskd-X.Y.Z                [6]

These commands are explained below:

  1. Unpacks the source tarball.  This creates the directory libtaskd-X.Y.Z,
     containing all the code.

  2. Change directory to the root of the distribution.

  3. Invokes CMake to scan for dependencies and machine-specific details, then
     generate the makefiles.  This may take a minute.

  4. Builds libtaskd.  This may take a minute.

  5. Installs the library, documentation and other files.

  6. Removes the temporary directory.


Build and configurations options
--------------------------------

You can customize the configuration run with cmake variables. This will modify
the installation process:

To change the installation directory you use the following configuration
variable:

  $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path-to-installation-dir> .

cmake configuration variables are applied with the -D option and consist of a
<name> and a <value>:

  $ cmake -D<name>=<value> .

Four more variables can customize the installation process. The following table
lists them and their defaults plus the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:

  CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX  /usr/local
  TASKD_BINDIR           bin
  TASKD_DOCDIR           share/doc/libtaskd
  TASKD_MAN1DIR          share/man/man1

The corresponding TASKD_* variables will be combined with CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX
to get absolute installation directoris:

  CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/TASKD_BINDIR   /usr/local/bin
  CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/TASKD_DOCDIR   /usr/local/share/doc/libtaskd
  CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/TASKD_MAN1DIR  /usr/local/share/man/man1


Uninstallation
--------------

To uninstall libtaskd, you need the Makefiles, so if you deleted them in step 7
above, they must first be regenerated by following steps [1], [2] and [3].  Then
simply run:

  $ sudo make uninstall TODO TODO TODO -- cmake doesn't include uninstall


Libtaskd Build Notes
-----------------

Libtaskd has dependencies that are detected by cmake in almost all cases, but
there are situations and operating systems that mean you will need to offer a
little help.

If libtaskd will not build on your system, first take a look at the Operating
System notes below.  If this doesn't help, then go to the Troubleshooting
section, which includes instructions on how to contact us for help.


Operating System Notes
----------------------


Troubleshooting
---------------

If you've recently made changes to dependencies (by reinstalling Lua, for
example) be sure to rerun 'cmake .' before trying to execute 'make' again.

CMake will run and locate all the necessary pieces for the build, and create
a Makefile.  There may be errors and warnings when running CMake, or there
may be compiler errors and warnings when running 'make'.  Sometimes you will run
CMake with no reported problems, and the build will fail later.  This is
almost always because CMake is mistaken about some assumption.

If a build does not succeed, please send the contents of the 'CMakeCache.txt' 
and 'CMakeFiles/CMakeOutput.log' files to support@taskwarrior.org, or post a
message in the support forums at taskwarrior.org along with the information.

If CMake runs but libtaskd does not build, please send the contents of the above
files as well as a transcript from the build, which is not written to a file and
must be captured from the terminal.
