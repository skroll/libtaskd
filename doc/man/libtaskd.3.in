.SH GENERAL USAGE

A Task Server client using this library needs to store the following:

- a local store of tasks
.br
- a local store of the sync key, initially an empty string
.br
- a list of tasks modified since the last taskd_sync call

When a sync is performed, the client will first call taskѕ_add_local_change for
each of the tasks modified since the last taskd_sync call.

The taskd_sync call is provided a copy of the sync key, which will be modified
by the server.  The modified sync key should be stored, and used in the next
call to taskd_sync.  Failure to provide a sync key, results in all tasks and
modifications being sent by the server.  Every time data on the server changes,
the sync key changes, as it is a reference to a change set.

On a successful taskd_sync call, there may be remotely changed tasks to be
retrieved.  Call taskd_get_remote_change repeatedly until it returns non-zero.
Each successful call will yield a remotely-modified task.  These tasks should
be parsed, and the UUID extracted.  If the UUID is found in the local task
store, then it should be replaced in its entirety.  If the UUID is not found in
the local store, it should be added.

If taskd_sync fails, the server error can be obtained by calling taskd_error.

On occasion the server will include a message to be seen by the user.  Obtain
this by calling taskd_server_message.  Such messages may include server downtime
notices, or account changes.

.SH ERRORS

0  success
.br
1  no data
.br
2  buffer too small
.br
3  bad argument
.br
4  malformed data
