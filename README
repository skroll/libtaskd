libtaskd
--------

This is a library that correctly implements the Task Server Protocol and acts as
a helper for all taskd clients.




Interface
---------

This is a rough sketch.

  bool initialize (server, port, organization, user, key, local_store);
  bool synch ();
  std::vector <std::string> loadUnfiltered ();
  std::vector <std::string> loadFiltered (filter);
  bool store (std::string& task);
